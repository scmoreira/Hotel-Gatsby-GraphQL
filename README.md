A Hotel site created to practice Gastby.

## Technologies used

1.  **[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)**

     Gatsby enables developers to build fast, secure, and powerful websites using a React-based framework and innovative data layer that makes integrating different content, APIs, and services into one web experience incredibly simple.

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site
    gatsby new my-project
    ```
    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

1.  **[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)**
    
    GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.
    Apps using GraphQL are fast and stable because they control the data they get, not the server.

1.  **[DatoCMS](https://www.datocms.com/)**

    DatoCMS is a cloud-based headless CMS designed to create online content at scale from a central hub and distribute it via API. 

1.  **[Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)**

    Emotion is a library designed for writing css styles with JavaScript.

    ```shell
    # install emotion
    npm i @emotion/react @emotion/styled
    ```

    Add the plugin in gastby-config.js file:
    `gatsby-plugin-emotion`
